This dish originates from the Sene-The Gambia region for centuries past, it is called Benachin which translates to \"One Pot\". All ingredients are cooked in a pot hence the name One Pot. Usually when cooking you do things simultaneously.\n\nBroken rice is used (very small rice) and it has a very distinctive redish colour and a famous spice in that region caled \"Maggi\" is used to enhance the taste.\nI'm Ghanaian so there's 0 bias in this.\nAnd having tasted variants from west African countries, This remains the best and authentic. I rest my case.\n\nThe owners of the dish haven't said anything in defence, they are just watching the Ghana man and Nigerians fight for no fruitful reason"

Lightly grease with oil or butter.\nOnce thoroughly heated, add 1/4 – 1/3 cup (60-80 milliliters) batter to the center and immediately tilt the pan in a circle to coat the bottom in a thin layer.\nCook until set on the top and the bottom turns golden, about 2 minutes.\nFlip and cook until the other side is golden, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Remove to plate. Rub the pan with more oil and repeat with remaining batter.\nServe immediately with sour cream, jam, honey, and/or sweetened condensed milk."

    ,"more_details":"The dish Luwombo is a traditional Ugandan delicacy that is steamed in banana leaves, showcasing the rich and diverse flavors of Ugandan cuisine. It is a royal dish and a common meal during holidays, with variations that include chicken, beef, mushrooms in a groundnut stew, or smoked fish in a plain groundnut stew. Luwombo is a special dish prepared for significant occasions like traditional marriages, parties, festivities, and last funeral rites, often served to important guests in the Baganda culture. The cooking process involves tying the ingredients in banana leaves and steaming them, a method that imparts a unique taste to the dish. Luwombo is a symbol of respect for visitors and is used to honor special occasions, with its absence at a ceremony considered a minor event in Buganda culture. The dish is not only popular among the Baganda people but has also been adopted by other tribes in Uganda and is a common feature on the menus of many Ugandan hotels and restaurants. Luwombo is often accompanied by a drink called Waragi, a local gin, or Ajono, a beer made from millet."

    ,"more_details":"Ndolé is a staple green leafy vegetable. Among the Sawa people, it holds traditional value. It's a Cameroonian dish prepared for major events such as weddings, baptisms, funerals, birthdays, etc. It can be found in the wild and sometimes near homes. Its preparation and cooking take an entire day. The most difficult part is haversting the leaves and washing the bitterness off, we always allow a small portion of the bitterness.\n\nFun facts :)\nThe bitter leaf plant, known scientifically as Vernonia Amygdalina, is a herb consumed in tropical climates, particularly in West Africa, where it's valued for both its ethnomedicinal properties and culinary uses. It's a key ingredient in local dishes like Cameroon's national dish, Ndolè, and Nigeria's Onugbu soup. The plant is notable for its bitter taste, which is considered a substitute for quinine, and it's often regarded as a universal remedy for numerous ailments.

    ,"more_details":"Eru soup is a traditional dish made from Eru or Okazi leaves, proteins, and palm oil, originating from the Bayangi people in Cameroon's South West Region. The Eru, a hardy green from the Gnetum Africanum plant, requires softening agents like waterleaves or spinach during cooking. Widely enjoyed, the dish is also prepared in Nigeria, where it's known as Afang soup, albeit with slight variations. A crucial ingredient is crayfish, and it's recommended to use palm oil sparingly for health reasons. The preparation takes about 30 minutes, not including the time to cook beef skin, also known as Canda. Eru soup can be served with starchy sides like water fufu, Garri, pounded yam, or similar options."

    ,"more_details":"Nkui is a cherished Bamiléké culinary tradition in Cameroon, specially prepared to celebrate the birth of a child and primarily served to the new mother. This dish features a unique, sticky sauce derived from the bark of the Triumfetta pentandra plant, enriched with a variety of spices, and is traditionally accompanied by hot fufu corn. Due to its adhesive nature, Nkui is consumed by hand, as utensils prove ineffective in grappling with its consistency. It holds a place of particular importance among women in their final trimester of pregnancy, esteemed for its role in easing childbirth. The dish is a staple in the \"Grassfields\" region of western Cameroon, an area noted for its residents' notable fertility. This reproductive acclaim among the \"Grassfield\" populace is largely ascribed to their dietary habits, especially the consumption of specific spices thought to boost fertility. Thus, Nkui is not just a meal but a cultural emblem, deeply intertwined with the practices and beliefs surrounding childbirth and maternal care."

    ,"more_details":"Pomme Pileés, also known as Banso Tukuni or mashed potatoes and beans, is a cherished comfort food from the West and Northwest Regions of Cameroon. This dish, a staple for the Banso people and widely consumed across these regions, boasts a rich blend of macronutrients: carbohydrates from potatoes, proteins from beans, and fats from palm oil, making it a favorite among families and farmers alike. Its resilience to spoilage under hot conditions and the absence of refrigeration make it particularly suitable for farmers and households in Cameroon. Pomme Pileés is celebrated as a satisfying meal after a long day's work, whether on the farm or in the office. \nSources: https://www.kengskitchen.com/cameroon-recipes/pomme-pilees-cameroonian-mashed-potatoes-and-beans | In my village Fokoue, when a women give birth, others women who are neighbors cometo visit her and they bring all ingredients and cook it for the new mother.

It can be served hot or room temperature. \nThe sandwich was created by an Italian deli owner in the early 1900s and the name derives from the specific type of bread used—a round Sicilian sesame loaf also called Muffuletta (spellings vary based on Sicilian dialect).

    ,"more_details":"Thingyan Htamin, which translates to Thingyan Rice, is a beloved celebration dish from the Mon ethnic people of south and southeastern Myanmar/ and predates the formation of modern Myanmar. The Mon founded one of the first major kingdoms of Myanmar and Northern Thailand, and are credited for establishing Theravada Buddhism across the region. They were also pre-historic \"river people\" and proliferated wet rice agriculture through the Irrawaddy delta, which eventually allowed Myanmar to become known as the Rice Bowl of Asia - these are proudly highlighted by the rice and saltwater fish in this dish. \n\nSimple as it is, as a Thingyan meal, the dish stimulates specific senses closely tied to the Myanmar Water Festival experience: the unusual wetness courtesy of our water sprinkling/splashing community customs (to wash away the past year's sins); the sweet and earthy combined fragrance of jasmine rice, sun-dried fish, green mango, and roasted chilis recalls the ubiquitous pre-monsoon aroma of hot rain,  jasmine garlands, and padauk leaves/flowers (padauk seasonally blooms during Thingyan and is Myanmar's national flower); and the smokiness infused into the assembled dish via a covered, lit beeswax candle, which channels the many candles folks would light on Thingyan Eve to welcome Thagyarmin for his annual earthly judgement (TGM is the Burmese \"King of Deities\" with origins in the pre-Buddhist animistic religions of Old Myanmar, analogous to the Vedic Indra or Ancient Greek Zeus).\n\nThailand has a similar dish (\"khao chae\", or \"soaked rice\") that was adapted from Thingyan Htamin. But don't worry, it's fully Mon and the Thais are still salty about our quabbles over Ayutthaya. ;)"

    ,"more_details":"(Disclaimer: This is written from the Myanmar perspective so please seek additional information from the Indian side.) This is a cold-weather dish from hill tribal regions of Upper Myanmar and northeastern India, and more specifically the Naga people. The Naga are a group of semi-isolated clans indigenous to the Sagaing, Chin, and Kachin states in Myanmar, and are famously known as fierce \"headhunters\" (partly bc of their ornate bone jewelry and body modifications, but largely bc of their actual warfare practices of decapitating enemy warriors during conflicts). Their ethnic self-determination and ferocity against local and foreign (i.e., the British) settlers are precisely why they were quickly granted tribal statehood in post-colonial Myanmar (the Naga Self-Administered Zone) and India (Nagaland). \n\nThe dish itself is extremely common throughout Myanmar, with various adaptations to suit local palates and ingredient availability - for example, the version pictured here was made with fermented mustard greens for the sour leafy component instead of the more traditional Mejenga leaves. The piercing fermented sour/spicy taste profile is mirrored in the ethnic dishes of the neighboring Kachin and Chin people, and resembles the tamarind-based soups of southern South Asia and Southeast Asia (e.g. Sri Lankan Rasam, Minangkabau/Malay Asam Pedas, and Filipino Sinigang). As with most hill-tribe cuisine, the stinkier and spicier, the better - especially when you're washing it down with an equally-potent swing of fermented rice \"beer\" (Zutho)."

    ,"more_details":"Also known as \"Golden Egg Curry\" (popularized by Naomi Duguid's cookbook, Burma: Rivers of Flavor). Burmese egg curries traditionally use duck eggs, but chicken is becoming increasingly common.\n\nThis dish is heavily influenced by South Asian egg curries - though it most resembles South Indian-style egg curries in its heavy use of tamarind. The Burmese elements are the fish sauce and dried shrimp powder (and sometimes dark fermented shrimp paste/belacan) - these ingredients can also be found in Thai and Malay versions of egg curry. The masala used is often home-made, but generally contains the same spice components as garam masala. Some variations of Burmese egg curry will contain asafoetida (hing), but this is less common."

It's a fresh sausage, meaning it is not cured, as the sausage is stuffed with pre-cooked ingredients. Cajun/Creole boudin is typically either pork or seafood, with rice and various seasonings. The filling is squeezed out of the casing and eaten straight, or on a cracker or other 'serving' food. Boudin in various forms exists most places the French have settled or had influence."

The crawfish are eaten straight from the shell, and sucking out the head is encouraged. It’s juicy and spicy, but with accents of lemon and garlic. When you eat, you pull the tail and eat the meat and then suck the fat and boil spices from the head. All the added veggies soak up the flavor too and some people will add anything to the boil (boiled pineapple is delicious!) There are some fusions, specifically with the local Vietnamese population that boil the crawfish and then cover it is a sauce. Originally, it comes from the Cajun culture, which is Acadian French ancestry. However, now everyone no I’ll s crawfish in New Orleans and it’s become a way to spend time enjoying each others company with great food!"

They were often given the off-cuts of meat (offal, heads, feet, necks, etc.) and this dish was developed as a means of stretching the meat further. It gets its name from the brown color the offal lends to the rice, and also from the idea that the off-cuts used in it were \"dirty\". Nowadays you will find dirty rice with more accepted (to the American mind) cuts of meat/sausage, but ideally it at least has chicken livers. Jambalaya, listed separately, is a derivation of dirty rice. Dirty rice is more a framework than a specific recipe--see below"

    ,"more_details":"Mohinga is the national dish of Myanmar, and another characteristically Burmese dish with tons of variations across the country. Alternative spellings include \"mohingar\", \"mohingha\", \"mont-hin-gar\" (a transliteration of the Burmese characters). The commonly accepted spelling/pronunciation, \"mohinga\", is a colloquial contraction of the Burmese name,  which roughly translates to \"lightly fermented thin rice noodles (mont) in bitter (kha) broth (hinn)\".\n\nThe standard formulation of mohinga comes from the Irrawaddy (or Ayeyarwaddy) Delta, specifically Ayeyarwaddy and Yangon, and is extremely peppery with a lighter broth and more pungent fish. Ethnic and regional adaptations range from the notoriously spicy versions from the Eastern- (Kayin/Karen) and Western-most states (Rakhine), to denser and less fishy versions in the Central, arid regions (Mandalay, Bagan, Mogok) due to the relative lack of wet rice and fish farming. Mohinga is predominantly a \"valley people\" dish from the river lowlands - there are fewer adaptations of mohinga from the northern hill states (Chin, Kachin, Shan), although some convergent varieties exist, such as Kengtung noodles from Shan State.\n\nThe toppings for mohinga are also extremely variable, ranging from chickpea and gourd fritters to Chinese youtiao. Mohinga topping offerings vary by region, and topping preferences are often highly personal."
